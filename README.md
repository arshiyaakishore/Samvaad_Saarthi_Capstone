# Samvaad Saarthi Capstone Project  
### Smart Glove Translator for Hindi Sign Language 

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Glove Translator** is a wearable gadget designed to enhance communication accessibility by translating **Hindi Sign Language** gestures into **real-time text and speech output**.

By integrating **accelerometers**, **flex sensors**, and **Arduino microcontrollers**, the glove accurately detects hand movements and gestures, focusing specifically on the needs of the **deaf and hard-of-hearing** community in India. This innovation aims to bridge the communication gap and empower more inclusive interpersonal interactions.

## 🔧 How It Works

- **Sensors & Hardware**:  
  The glove is embedded with:
  - Flex sensors to detect finger bending  
  - Accelerometers for motion tracking  
  - Arduino microcontroller for data processing

- **Gesture Recognition & Translation**:  
  Predefined ISL gestures are stored in the glove’s onboard memory. When a gesture is performed:
  1. Sensor data is processed by the microcontroller.  
  2. The corresponding word or phrase is matched from the internal database.  
  3. The recognized text is synthesized and transmitted via **Bluetooth**.

- **Output Delivery**:  
  The translated message is delivered both as **text** (on a display or app) and **audio output** via a **Bluetooth-connected speaker**, ensuring clear and accessible communication.
