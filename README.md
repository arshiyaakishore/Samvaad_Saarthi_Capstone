In order to improve communication accessibility, a wearable gadget that can
translate Indian Sign Language (ISL) motions into real-time text and vocal output
is being created by our project, the Smart Glove Translator.

The glove combines
accelerometers, flex sensors, and Arduino microcontrollers to detect hand
movements and gestures correctly. By concentrating on ISL, the unique
requirements of the deaf and hard-of-hearing members of the Indian community
can be better met and their capacity for interpersonal communication can be
improved.

The Smart Glove Translator keeps a database of frequently used words and phrases
in its memory to facilitate smooth communication. A certain motion connected to
a sentence that has been saved is identified by the glove's built-in processing power,
and then the relevant text is pulled out of memory. The intended message can then
be clearly and audibly sent using a Bluetooth-connected speaker that receives the
synthesized text. This novel method ensures adaptability and ease of use for users
in various communication contexts.
User-centered design and practicality, in addition to technological innovation, are
prioritized in our project. The accuracy and reactivity of the Smart Glove Translator
to work well in everyday situations are aimed to be improved by us. This will be
done by iteratively testing and soliciting feedback from fluent speakers of ISL.
People with hearing impairments are aimed to be enabled to participate more boldly
and inclusively in everyday encounters, therefore encouraging accessibility and
creating a more inclusive society by utilizing developments in sensor technology
and signal processing algorithms.
